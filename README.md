## Comparision of Different Model used in Breast Cancer Detection 

Breast Cancer Detection using machine learning comes into picture because the doctors do not identify each and every patient. Thatâ€™s why the number of women affected by breast cancer are still increasing.
So, we are using some models for detecting breast cancer. We are using Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for detection. And using the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic data set for predictive analysis. We will use 70% of the data set for learning the model and remaining 30 % dataset will be used  for testing the model.
The attributes we using are ID number, Diagnosis, ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus (radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension). By using this we will calculate the accuracy of each model for both train data set and test data set. Then we will compare the accuracy of each model.
After training the Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models with train data set we got accuracies 94.724%, 96.985%, 88.693%, 87.688%, 87.437% and with test data set we got accuracies 95.906%, 97.076%, 90.058%, 87.719%, 84.211% respectively.
So, after analysing the five models we came to conclude that the Decision Tree mode is the best we got 97% accuracy and second-best model is Random Forest we got 95% accuracy.


# INTRODUCTION

Breast Cancer is one of the major health issues occurring in women. It is caner which starts in the breast tissue. Major problem with this disease is that we are still unknown with the actual cause of this cancer and scientist are working on it day n night.
Some of the commonly known symptoms that are being used these days to detect the breast cancer are-
1.	Breast rash 
2.	Change is the size, shape, or appearance of the breast
3.	Occasional Discharge from the nipple
4.	A lump or mass in the breast that feels uneven from the surrounding tissue
5.	Changes in the skin over the breast
6.	Mild or sever Breast pain
7.	Inverted or pulling-in of the nipple
8.	Abrupt scaling and peeling of skin around the darker region of nipple.

We as a Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence enthusiastic have come up with some model comparisons that can be used to detect the breast cancer based on the breast scan that contains some of the features such as cell nucleus (radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension) which we are using to train our model. These are based on the common symptoms that are being used by the doctors to predict the breast cancer.
We are using this model so that we can come up with a best model with high accuracy so that it can be used in real life medical field.
